This project integrates **Llama 3.1** as a agent with the **LangChain framework** to enable network diagnostics and analysis through simple natural language prompts. It leverages a suite of powerful networking tools to identify potential issues, vulnerabilities, and threats in a network.

## Features

1. **Llama 3.1 + LangChain Integration**  
   - Central AI agent for orchestrating tools via LangChain.  
   - Simplifies network diagnostics using natural language prompts.  

2. **Network Scanning with Nmap**  
   - **Nmap** for port detection, service/OS fingerprinting, and vulnerability identification.  
   - Llama interprets results to highlight open ports, services, and potential risks.  

3. **Traffic Analysis via Wireshark & Tcpdump**  
   - **Wireshark** and **Tcpdump** for packet inspection and anomaly detection.  
   - Llama analyzes traffic to identify suspicious patterns or protocol errors.  

4. **Vulnerability & Penetration Testing**  
   - **Metasploit**, **OpenVAS**, and **Burp Suite** for vulnerability scanning and exploit development.  
   - Llama guides users through testing and suggests remediation steps.  

5. **Wi-Fi & Password Security**  
   - **Aircrack-ng**, **John the Ripper**, and **Hydra** for Wi-Fi testing and password cracking.  
   - Llama identifies weak credentials and insecure configurations.  

6. **Threat Intelligence with Shodan & Maltego**  
   - **Shodan**, **ZMap**, and **Maltego** for internet-wide scanning and OSINT.  
   - Llama processes data to uncover exposed devices and map attack surfaces.  

## Tools Used

- **Nmap**: Network scanning and enumeration.  
- **Wireshark/Tcpdump**: Packet capture and analysis.  
- **Metasploit/OpenVAS/Burp Suite**: Vulnerability and penetration testing.  
- **Aircrack-ng/John the Ripper/Hydra**: Wi-Fi and password security testing.  
- **Shodan/ZMap/Maltego**: Threat intelligence and OSINT analysis.
